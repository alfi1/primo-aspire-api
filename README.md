# primo-aspire-api
Link from Primo new ui to Talis Aspire API to display the reading lists on which an item is cited.

The script gets the MMSID of the item from the full display, makes a call to the Aspire API, and then displays the results in Primo.

20/01/2017.  The script looks to be running well.  More in-house testing will be condicted before we go live with it on production Primo.
